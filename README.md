# Semester_Project
A trading system project using C++ is a software application that is designed 
to analyze financial markets and make automated trading decisions. 
The system typically includes algorithms that are designed to identify
market trends and conditions that will lead to profitable trades. 
The project will involve developing a platform using the C++ programming 
language that will allow traders to programmatically submit orders,
manage their portfolios, and monitor market conditions. 
The system will also need to include robust risk management tools
to manage the downside risk of the portfolio. Additionally,
the project will require a deep understanding of financial markets,
trading strategies, and risk management principles. Ultimately,
the goal of the project is to create a highly reliable and profitable
trading system that will help traders earn consistent profits in financial markets.
